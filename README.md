I'm a medical student with a strong passion for programming. My main interests are in **Python** and **Rust**, and I love working on projects that dive deep into the Linux desktop, low-level Linux components, and backend systems.

I'm here to contribute to open-source projects, share what I’ve learned, and hopefully help others along the way.
